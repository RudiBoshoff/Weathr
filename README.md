Work in progress.
TODO: 
 1. JS needs to be refactored.
 2. Desktop styling needs to be adjusted with media queries. (search bar is ugly)
 3. Site needs to be hosted on heroku. 
 4. Loading animation when opening app

Limitations: 
 1. API does not allow for week prediction at current cost (free)
 2. Sunset and sunrise times do not adjust based on user location. So times are in GMT without accounting for local timezone.
