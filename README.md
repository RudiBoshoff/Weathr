# Weathr
Mobile First Weathr app that uses open-weather api to update values. The app has search functionality as well as searches for the weather at your location

Work in progress.
TODO: 
 1. JS needs to be refactored.
 2. Desktop styling needs to be adjusted with media queries. (search bar is ugly)
 3. Site needs to be hosted on heroku.
